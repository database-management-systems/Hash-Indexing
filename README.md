# Hash-Indexing
The Employee.csv file we used for our tests is provided in the zip package, but you can also test our code with the new Employee.csv file

You can compile and run the code by following these steps:
1. Employee.csv must be in the same directory as main.c
2. Use the following commands to compile and run C++ code

```c
g++ main.cpp -o main.out

main.out
```
